# Waveframe Labs

**Independent Research Initiative for Reproducible AI–Human Science**

---

## Overview

Waveframe Labs is a self-directed open-science organization developing reproducible frameworks for AI-assisted reasoning, validation, and discovery.  
Our mission is to demonstrate that scientific method can operate independently of institutions — driven by transparent workflows, verifiable artifacts, and continuous orchestration between human insight and machine intelligence.

## Core Projects

| Project | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **[Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO)](https://github.com/Wright-Shawn/Aurora-Workflow-Orchestration)** | Defines the Aurora Method — a reproducible research workflow framework linking AI reasoning with human validation. |
| **[CRI-CORE](https://github.com/Wright-Shawn/CRI-Core)** | Execution layer that runs AWO workflows deterministically and records immutable audit trails. |
| **[Waveframe v4.0](https://github.com/Wright-Shawn/Waveframe-v4.0)** | Observer-driven cosmology exploring information-based expansion and entropy-action dynamics. |
| **[Societal Health Simulator](https://github.com/Wright-Shawn/Societal-Health-Simulator)** | Modeling framework for systemic progress and societal resilience. |

## Research Philosophy

Waveframe Labs approaches science as a workflow problem, not an institutional privilege.  
Every project follows the same reproducible pattern:

```
Design → Orchestrate → Verify → Publish → Archive
```

Each phase is logged, versioned, and validated through human–AI collaboration.
